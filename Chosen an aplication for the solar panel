We have chosen a specific application to select a solar panel that can produce the watts necessary for the application.
We will apply the system to a parking meter that consumes about 16 watts.
Here the web page where we find the parking meter http://www.toledo-ora.es/funcionamiento/
Nevertheless we have to change the solar because the dimensions and weight are so big to the servomotors torque that we are able to shop. The specific application now is a little 
diferent. We are going to desigh a device that trucks the sun to feed a parking a meter without the condition of produce 16 watts with the solar panel.
